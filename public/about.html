<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Ralph Lawrence Frigillana, an aspiring software developer with a deep
  passion for coding and problem-solving. Though I’m relatively new to the
  programming world, I’ve dedicated myself to learning and growing through
  hands-on projects, coding bootcamps, and self-study.
</p>

<p>
  I’m excited about building things from scratch, whether it’s a simple web app
  or a data-driven solution. Currently, I’m focused on mastering JavaScript,
  HTML/CSS, React, etc.], and I’m always looking for opportunities to learn new
  technologies and techniques.
</p>

<p>
  I approach programming with curiosity and persistence, always striving to
  break down challenges and find the best way forward. I believe in the
  importance of clean, efficient code, and I’m committed to writing solutions
  that are not only functional but also scalable and easy to maintain.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, you can usually find me reading manhwas, cycling outside,
  and playing instrument at church.
</p>

<p>
  I’m eager to connect with like-minded individuals, learn from experienced
  developers, and contribute to meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out if
  you’d like to collaborate or chat!
</p>
